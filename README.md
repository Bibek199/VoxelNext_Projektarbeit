# VoxelNext_Projektarbeit HKA_WS_23-24
3D object detection for autonomous driving with VoxelNext model with nuScenes and KITTI Dataset. 

In this project we try to reproduce the results of the paper "VoxelNeXt: Fully Sparse VoxelNet for 3D Object Detection and Tracking" (CVPR 2023)

**VoxelNeXt: Fully Sparse VoxelNet for 3D Object Detection and Tracking [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11301)]** <br />
VoxelNeXt is a clean, simple, and fully-sparse 3D object detector. It predict objects directly upon sparse voxel features without sparse-to-dense conversion, anchors, or center proxies.
